# ZendeskCodingChallenge

The program I wrote creates a user interface that allows users to browse the tickets in their Zendesk account. In order for this program to work, the user needs to change the code to include their individual Zendesk site and their Username and Password.

This program is designed to be used with Command Line Instructions and was written in Python 3.8.
